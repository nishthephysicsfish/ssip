  <h1>About the Author</h1>

  <p>Hello! My name is <span class="highlight">Nishtha Tikalal</span>. Back when I was in high school, I didn't even know that doing research was a thing, and now it's something so common in the high school setting.</p>

  <p>Even when I entered college I knew I wanted to jump into research, but had absolutely no idea where to start. Thus, my journey in research started by picking up a paper map. Despite living an hour away from campus and classes starting at the crack of dawn, I would arrive ~1â€“2 hours early to take a different route to my parking garage. Each different path led me down a new street showcasing the vast depth of research opportunities that were happening at my university.</p>

  <p>I took names and notes, cross-referencing affiliations with my department's faculty and interests. The one thing I didn't have at the time was connections or a resume. I had no experience. Thus, I resorted to cold emailing. Two whole years went by and I was still getting ghosted or rejected.</p>

  <p>But, with a stroke of serendipity, my email made its way to a professor who saw my grit and work ethic. I have been working in that lab ever since, along with two others that encapsulate my interests within my fields of study. With such experiences, I was able to present at numerous conferences, receive recognition for my work via awards and fellowships, and deliver some award-winning presentations.</p>

  <p>The SSI program was built in order to elucidate and debunk research early on. Many students think that research conducted as a student (high school or even undergraduate) doesn't matter. It is not a CV filler, and it does play an integral role for your future endeavors.</p>

  <p>It is a humbling experience that teaches you to not only tackle and share complex ideas, but transferable skills such as patience and resilience.</p>

  <p>As an aspiring researcher, I am passionate about guiding others through the challenges I faced and helping them discover how meaningful and rewarding research can be early in their academic journeys.</p>
